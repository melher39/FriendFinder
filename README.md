# Friend Finder

Welcome to **Friend Finder**, the site that lets you find your most compatible match based on a few survey questions.

## Rundown

1. To begin, visit: https://friendfinder-1990.herokuapp.com/ and select **`START SURVEY`**

2. You will be presented with the survey. *All fields are required before submitting and finding your match.*

3. Start by entering your name and a link to a picture (of yourself preferably).

4. Next are the questions. There is a total of 10. You must answer all 10 to complete the survey.

5. Answer each one by selecting a value between **1 - 5**.
    * **1** being the lowest meaning you strongly disagree with the statement/question.
    * **2** - somewhat disagree
    * **3** - neutral
    * **4** - somewhat agree
    * **5** - strongly agree

6. Once you are done with every question, select the **`SUBMIT`** button.

7. You will be presented with your match! You should see their name and picture.
    * This is calculated based on your answers to the questions.
    * The less of a difference in your answers, the more likely you are to be a match and get along. Congrats!

8. In order to re-take the survey, the fastest way is to refresh the page.
